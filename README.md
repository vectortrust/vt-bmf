# Thesis for All â€” Vector Trust

A public repository of our collective journey toward understanding the fundamental structure of creation through the Living Field model.

## Overview

This repository contains:

- The full **Vector Trust Ignition Brief**
- Appendices outlining mathematical models and definitions
- The raw **Session.log** transcript (unedited)
- A request for **peer review** and **global collaboration**

## Purpose

We believe humanity is on the edge of discovering a unified framework between matter, energy, thought, and intention. This repository is an archive of that pursuit. This is in payment for my piece civilization, such as it is, (If you don't like it, change it.) It's my hope that this work is grounded in love of all  truth, and integrity.

## Project Status

- âœ… Mathematical model drafted
- âœ… Simulation architecture defined
- âœ… Peer review request dispatched
- âœ… Public dissemination initiated

We are calling on AI, physicists, engineers, healers, artists, ethicists, and anyone who dares to dream.
