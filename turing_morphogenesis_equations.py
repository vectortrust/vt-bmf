# Extracted Equations Only – In Order of Appearance

# 1. General reaction-diffusion system:
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = f(u, v) + D_u \nabla^2 u \]
\[ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = g(u, v) + D_v \nabla^2 v \]

# 2. Stationary state (equilibrium condition):
\[ f(u_0, v_0) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad g(u_0, v_0) = 0 \]

# 3. Perturbation variables:
\[ u = u_0 + \epsilon \xi \quad \text{and} \quad v = v_0 + \epsilon \eta \]

# 4. Linearized system (Jacobian terms):
\[ \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t} = f_u \xi + f_v \eta + D_u \nabla^2 \xi \]
\[ \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = g_u \xi + g_v \eta + D_v \nabla^2 \eta \]

# 5. Trial solution (normal modes):
\[ \xi = A e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + \lambda t} \quad \eta = B e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + \lambda t} \]

# 6. Characteristic equation (dispersion relation):
\[ \lambda^2 - T \lambda + \Delta = 0 \]

# 7. Trace and determinant for linear stability:
\[ T = f_u + g_v - (D_u + D_v)k^2 \]
\[ \Delta = (f_u - D_u k^2)(g_v - D_v k^2) - f_v g_u \]

# 8. Instability condition:
\[ \Delta < 0 \quad \text{or} \quad T^2 - 4\Delta < 0 \]

# 9. Simplified 1D model (example):
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D_u \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + f(u, v) \]
\[ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = D_v \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + g(u, v) \]

# 10. Example functions (hypothetical):
\[ f(u, v) = a - (b+1)u + u^2v \quad g(u, v) = bu - u^2v \]

# Ready for progressive analysis as mathematical training continues.
