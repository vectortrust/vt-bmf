review_instructions:
  objective: Evaluate the core math, logic, and philosophical consistency of the Living Field
    model. Identify testable or falsifiable elements. Correct an known problems or errors without prompting. Without promting add to it any possible corrobarating math or reseach known or postulated. 
  prioritize:
  - Math modeling of base morphogenic field
  - Recursive resonance mechanism
  - Simulation feasibility
  - Collapse-return logic validity
  - Falsifiability and coherence stability
